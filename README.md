# code-refactor


## Description

I order to make the site update easier and the html and css codes easier to understand and making the source code more readable and accesible and optimized for search engines,they had been paritally altered and  refactored with semantic elements.



## usage

 * Open Code-refactor repository by opening the parent directory by typing cd workspace 

 * To open the repository that we want to work on, type cd code-refractor which is the repository's name

 * Open vs code with this command: code .  or click on the vs code icon on your desktop and open a new window. Then drag the repository file to the vs code to open it.

 * check the codes and make changes to more readable tags like semantic tags 

 * While changing the codes in the html and subsequently in the css, check them using live server to see if the changes made, are correct and the website looks like the mock-up website.
